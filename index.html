  <h2>Skulk</h2>
  <p>
    There are many kinds of skulk, first is the skulk sencor. It is a block that has a viney look to it, and it detects motion, and it outputs a redstone signal. It can also activate its brother, the skulk shrieker. <br>
    The shrieker is a block that when activated, gives a spine chilling sound that when used enough, can summon the <span class = "skulk-color">WARDEN.</span> I will cover that later.<br>
    Next is the skulk catalyst. When a mob dies next to this block, depending how much XP it drops, some skulk blocks be summoned. Skulk blocks are harvested with a hoe.
